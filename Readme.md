## WELCOME!

After several years working in a different career I discovered how much I enjoy programming, so I decided to enrole in an intensive Bootcamp which lasted 3 months with the goal of boosting my  technical skills. I'm a fast learner that enjoys problem-solving by applying logic and a goal oriented person.

I'm eager to grow in the IT world, actively looking for chances to succeed in this objective. I inivite you to check the pojects that I made during my bootcamp
